# Pysweeper
**Required modules**
- Pygame

~~## Blind?
As of this iteration, I don't have a good pathfinding system yet, aka each tile pressed does not open up any other tile and does not show mine proximity, therefore it's "blind".~~
It's not blind anymore!

## Other Tips
- There is a debug menu to find locations of all mines that is set to False by default.

        self.isDebug = False
